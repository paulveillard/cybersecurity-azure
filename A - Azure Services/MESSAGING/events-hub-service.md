# Azure Event Hubs: Introduction, Architecture, and Security | Microsoft Azure

Big data has revolutionized the way we do business. Analyzing information in real-time to capture actionable insights can be the difference between maintaining your edge and lagging behind. But, building the right infrastructure to manage your constant flow of data becomes complex. Azure Event Hubs streamlines your data pipelines for you. So, the journey from input to insights is seamless.

## 1 - Azure Event Hub: Overview

**Events Hubs** Ingests, Buffers, Stores, Processes Data in real-Time. Azure Event Hubs are designed for big data ingestion from a different variety of sources such as social data, web apps, sensor data, weather data, IoT devices, etc.
- It is sure that we can receive events from a variety of sources, fast, and in order, and store events reliably and durably.
- It also supports multiple consumers and consumer groups for quick and concurrent data processing.
- We can choose to capture all incoming data in Azure Storage, or we can also decide to trigger Azure Functions in response to new events.
- We can process data streams using Spark, or we can write our own systems for data processing and receiving events from Azure Event Hubs.
